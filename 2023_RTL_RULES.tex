\begin{abstract}
\RTL{} is a Tournament
series for the video game Reassembly. Unlike most Reassembly Tournaments, where
a deadline is set well ahead of the tournament stream, in RTL,
building takes place live: two participants share their screens and
build ships under a relatively short time limit. The tournament spans
for a whole month; participants must choose a time from multiple
tournament days, allowing a greater amount of people to participate live.
RTL is made to be fast paced and fun to watch.

\section{Logistics}
\subsection{How to Participate}
To participate in \RTL{}, please fill out this \textbf{entry form.}

The form will list all days during which a livestream will take place, the name you'd like to
be called on stream, your email address, your Discord username, and 
some (optional) additional info that you'd like to be mentioned during the stream.

\section{Tournament Structure}
After the rules are posted, participants must select all timeslots they are available for.
See ``How to Participate''.

When your entry is confirmed, I will send an email to the address specified in your entry form.
I will check to make sure that you will be available on the days you specify.
I will perform this check one day before the stream as well.\\

After the Participation Deadline passes, the tournament schedule will be posted to Discord.
You will get to see the assigned matches 

\section{The Livestream}
In \RTL{}, all shipbuilding and tournament play happen during the Livestream.

Participants will be prepared before the livestream so that it goes smoothly.

For each round in each match, the tournament host selects a new set of rules. Participants are
given a Build Period to construct a rules-compliant fleet or ship. When the build period ends,
the host will fight the participants' fleets or ships together. This determines the outcome of
a round.

\subsection{Livestream Preparations}
Everyone who has an assigned match will be placed into a Discord server. 

In order to ensure that things go smoothly when the tournament goes live, before the stream, 
all participants will be placed into a Discord voice channel. I will ask all participants to open 
Reassembly and to share their screen using the website VDO.ninja.

\subsection{During the Livestream}
During the livestream, everyone who has an assigned match will be asked to stay in a voice
channel. This signifies that they are ready to be called for their match. 

When the livestream starts, I will call matches in the order specified in the match schedule.
If someone is late, I will skip their match. If they do not appear
30 minutes after the final match of the day, their match will be held on the next tournament day.

\subsubsection{Match Structure}
Matches are always between two participants.
When a match is started, both participants will be placed into another Discord voice channel.

Both participants will be asked to share their screen using VDO.ninja. Both of their screens 
will be shown on the livestream.

Each match has three (3) rounds.

Participants will be given a short period to get ready. 

When both participants declare themselves as ready, the match shall begin.

Each round, the host will select a set of Round Rules. The participants will each be given 
one minute to read these Rules and configure their tournament settings. See the section ``Round 
Rules Selection'' for more info.

Then, participants will be given twenty (20) minutes to construct a ship or fleet that is rules-compliant.
This time is called the Build Period.
When a participant is done making their ship, they must Submit it to me by posting it on the 
Discord Server in the appropriate channel. Participants may submit as many times as they want
before the end of the Build Period.

If the time limit passes before a participant has posted their file onto the Discord Server, they 
will be allowed to export their file ONCE.

After recieving a file, the host will check it against the Round Rules.

See ``Build Period Specifics'' for more information.

After both participants have submitted their files, the host will place them into the tournament 
page, configure the tournament settings according to the Round Rules, and run the tournament. The 
outcome of this tournament determines who wins the round.

% will be allowed to export their file ONCE. If they are determined to be able to export the file within five (5) minutes of the 
% end of the Build Period, but do not, they will lose the match.
